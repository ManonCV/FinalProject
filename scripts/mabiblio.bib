	abstract = {Bank Swallows (Riparia riparia) congregate in large nocturnal roosts during the non-breeding season. Scant evidence suggests that Bank Swallows may also congregate regularly in nocturnal roosts during the breeding period. To help clarify the issue, we used automated radio-telemetry to document the roosting behavior of 11 males and 11 females that were tending nests with young at two nesting colonies. Nineteen of the 22 birds (86\%) spent at least one night roosting away from the colony, and 13 of the 22 birds (59\%) spent at least one night roosting likely within a large marsh located {\textasciitilde}30 km away from the colonies. Females tended to roost overnight at the colony more than males. The proportion of nights birds spent roosting away from the colony was highly variable between individuals. Minimum flight speeds to an evening roost site ({\textasciitilde}30 km distant) were significantly greater than return flights back to the colony in the morning. Our study confirms that breeding Bank Swallows do in fact regularly roost away from the colony during the nestling period. Our study also highlights some new and intriguing questions regarding how Bank Swallows use the landscape during the breeding season, and the potential importance of wetland roost sites in the proximity of breeding colonies.},

	abstract = {The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) in central Mexico was established in 2000 to protect monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) overwintering colonies and contribute to the conservation of the monarch migratory phenomenon. The MBBR has faced forest cover losses due to illegal logging and climate-related factors. Here we report forest cover losses from 2012 to 2018 in the core zones of the MBBR where most monarch overwintering colonies perch. We used aerial ortho-photographs and satellite images complemented with field validation for temporal comparisons. During this period, 163.44 ha of forest cover were affected, 125.44 ha due to climate-related factors (rain and wind), 25.86 ha due to large-scale illegal logging, and 12.14 ha due to small-scale illegal logging. The core zone of the MBBR located in the State of Michoacan showed the highest forest cover loss values with 94.07 ha lost due to climate-related factors, and 38.0 ha lost due to illegal logging. Our study also showed a substantial decrease of {\textasciitilde}98\% in large-scale illegal logging in the core zones of the MBBR compared to previous reported forest losses from 2001 to 2012. Forest cover loss was similar, yet the periods of the two studies differed, one 12 years in length, this one 6 years. The decrease of forest cover during the period studied suggests that factors elsewhere rather than forest cover loss in the monarch butterfly's winter habitat have strongly contributed to the dramatic population declines observed in monarch overwintering colonies since 2010.},
